## Making changes to UI only
When you are planning to make the chnages in the UI and validate against the api server then run the spring boot application and at the same time run the react app
* From the times-exam directory fire `./gradlew bootRun -PisLocal=true` it will run the java application which will give the access to API
* From the times-exam-web directory start the npm `npm start`, this will run the node app


## Testing the APP
